Hey there! If you’re diving into iOS development and find Core Data a bit overwhelming, you’re not alone. It’s a powerful tool for managing data in your apps, but it’s actually not as tricky as it seems.

In this guide, I’ll break down the basics of Core Data and show you how to handle the essential CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations. By the end, you’ll be ready to build more robust apps with ease. Let’s jump in!

If you have any questions or need further clarification, I will be uploading a video demonstration of my Core Data project. Stay tuned for more detailed explanations!
